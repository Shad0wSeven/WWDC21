 # Credits
 
 **NOTE:** I don't really count this as part of the 3 minute experience

 This will just be in mark(down)up, as there is no real need for code to explain all the image sources, references used for text and issues with code and whatnot.

 I **DID** however include a cool image and quote that I think is really impactful so if you want hit that "Run Code" :D

 ## Images and Text

 All images were listed as Creative Commons or were from the Wikimedia Foundation. Information was pulled from CarbonBreif, NOAA, NASA, and University pages, although most of it was just from me reading in the past.

 ## Code

 Code was written in Swift 5.0 with Xcode 12.4, Swift Playgrounds 3.4.1 on a 2018 iMac base, as well as a 7th generation iPad with the latest as of writing version of Swift Playgrounds.

 UIKit and SwiftUI were both used, SceneKit was used to generate most of the features in the scene, the background was ARKit, no other notable frameworks were used.

 The code used, if you choose to browse is a bit messy, but due to the "Hackathon" style nature of this competition, with the submissions opening right as WWDC is announced (hyped for iOS15 and macOS <california landmark>, but most importantly Craig who is hilariously fun) and closing around two and a bit weeks later.
