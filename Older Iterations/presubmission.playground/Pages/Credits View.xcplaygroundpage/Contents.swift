/*: some text
 # Credits
 
 This will just be in mark(down)up, as there is no real need for code to explain all the image sources, references used for text and issues with code and whatnot.
 
 ## General Complaints
 
 I had a few just complaints about the workflow I used, I have access to a 7th generation iPad, not exactly an 11 inch iPad Pro, but close enough, as well as an iMac18,1 (2018)
