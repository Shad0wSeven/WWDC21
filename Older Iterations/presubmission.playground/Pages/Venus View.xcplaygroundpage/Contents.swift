 # Venus
 
 Venus is a hellish landscape with the hottest surface temperature of any planet in the solar system - even Mercury, however hundreds of millions of years ago, Venus was much like the earth, belived to have an ocean and an atmosphere. However, being too close to the sun, outside the "Goldilocks Zone" led to it quickly decending into a runaway greenhouse effect and becoming the closest thing to hell we know of.
