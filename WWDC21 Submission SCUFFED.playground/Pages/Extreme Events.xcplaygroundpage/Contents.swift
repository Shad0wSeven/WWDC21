# Extreme Events

Hurricanes, massive floods, storms, as humans we see these events as rare and extremely powerful, this is exemplified in the Nordic Thor. God of storms lighting and curiously enough trees, was seen as ultimate strength.

These extreme phenomena used to be once in a millennia events, skipping centuries and remembered as legends. In many major religions past and present a Flood story is almost universal and probably did happen a monster extreme storm.

The problem is these are becoming increasingly common, to the point where twice a millennia events are being expected twice a decade. Almost 70% of recent extreme weather events are connected with human activity connected with climate change with 92% of them being found to be increased in severity by human activity.
