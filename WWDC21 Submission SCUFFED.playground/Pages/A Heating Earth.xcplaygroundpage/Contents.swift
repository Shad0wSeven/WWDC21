# A Heating Earth

The Earth is growing warmer.

There is countless evidence that this is happening, and almost all of it points to human activity.

From the extinction of a large chunk of Earth's flora and fauna to the triumph of Science over industry that happened once, the world is changing, and there are clear signs it's not in a good way.
