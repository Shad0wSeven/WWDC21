# Rising Seas

The ocean, covering almost three-quarters of our planet, giving it its name as the blue marble. The ocean is not calm and stagnant however contradicting its appearance from space. It is a turbulent pulsating unfathomably large mass of water.

The ocean has also commonly been our weapon against temperature and CO2. Back in more sane times, it used to help regulate temperature and CO2 through absorption, able to be a great sink. With CO2 levels relatively stagnant this system worked great. However in the past 150 years, the temperature is heating parts of the ocean, acidification through too much CO2 is causing its trillions of inhabitants to fall sick and die, not to mention the monolithic masses of ice at the poles of the Earth, in danger of melting and eating up our coastlines.
