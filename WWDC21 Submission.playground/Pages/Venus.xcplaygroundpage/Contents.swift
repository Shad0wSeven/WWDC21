 # Venus
 
We can learn a lot about climate change from Venus, our sister planet. Venus currently has a surface temperature of 450℃ and an atmosphere dominated by carbon dioxide with a density 90 times that of Earth’s.

However, it has been found that Venus most likely had an Earth-like climate. Up until around 750 million years ago, Venus had surface water, oceans, a habitable temperature, perhaps even snow rain, and possibly even life. However, around 750 million years ago, volcanoes on its surface pumped out massive amounts of CO2 leading to a runaway greenhouse gas effect that destroyed the once nitrogen-rich atmosphere turning it into the Carbon Dioxide and Sulfuric acid dominated hell it is today.

Venus itself is probably the starkest warning to humanity that the earth that has sustained us for so long, could easily turn into something like Venus if we allow our own runaway greenhouse effect to continue.

In the scene itself, there are only a few landmarks as we haven't searched much of Venus' surface yet, our landers burning up mere hours after touching down.
