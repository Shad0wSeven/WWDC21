<div align="center">
  
## Premise:

</div>

- Global Warming awareness project, using ARKit SceneKit and UI Stuff.

<div align="center">
  
## Names:

</div>

- `WWDC21 Submission.playground` is the final file, the rest are just stuff I made right before submitting, I submitted the actual zip file in the repository

- `/Older Iterations/` is litearly older versions. Basically useless but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

## How to Run

</div>

- ARKit, so needs an iPad running Swift Playgrounds. **NOTE: NOT TESTED ON ANY iPAD SMALLER THAN A 7th GENERATION.**

- Then just download the playground to your files, and run it!

- Only tested on iPadOS 14, and for sure will not work with iOS <11
